## Caveat
This is an untested revision of the original board which had some clearance issues. I believe they have been rectified but please do double check!

THe clock modulator circuit requires a fairly simple modifaction to the board in order to override the clock input (x). All you have to do is remove the crystal and replace with the output at pin x, which is a new clock being generated by the pt2399. From what I can tell, the frequency of the DSP boards clock changes between manufacturers so experimentation to find the ideal frequency and modulation amount. If that doesn't excite then you could just modify the PCB layout and remove that whole part of the circuit from the PCB and front panel.

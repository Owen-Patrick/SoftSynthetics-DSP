# Soft Synthetics DSP Adapator
This Repository Contains hardware for adapting a cheap Karaoke DSP board to eurorack.

It turns one of these:

into an 10HP eurorack stereo multi-effects module with some fun clock modulation voltage control:

## Caveats
v1.1 This is an untested revision of the original board which had some clearance issues. I believe they have been rectified but please do double check! I have not printed it because v1.0 did work with plenty of bodging which I do not recommend.

THe clock modulator circuit requires a fairly simple modifaction to the board in order to override the clock input (x). All you have to do is remove the crystal and replace with in a header to connect "x" instead, which is a new clock siglan being generated by the pt2399. From what I can tell, the frequency of the DSP boards clock changes between manufacturers so experimentation to find the ideal frequency and modulation amount. If that doesn't excite then you could just modify the PCB layout and remove that whole part of the circuit from the PCB and front panel. 

It's also not the prettiest in constuction and requires some pretty cosy bends of the cables that connect the DSP boards display and main board (i've seen some folk replace that cable with softer wires). The final consution is as so:

*the display board attaches to the main back board of via 2 M3 stadnoffs.
*That display board connects to the interface with an m3 standoff and 2.54mm pin headers. 
*The DSP processor board mounts to the interface.
*The cables fit together that way you'd expect: x to the clock in, in, Lout, Rout to the DSP PCB, and 5v to power in of the DSP. 

If I have time i'll make a little diagram at some point! until then it mostly makes sense.

This project is a culmination of various other creators work into one package which shares the benefits they each brung to the table. Those insanley talented peaople are:
